Hey, you there!

I am Nandhitha, a software engineer. I like to think of it more like solving problems. I have a wide breadth of experience building engineering systems.
I like novelty, and like to work on challenging problem statements, even if niche or obscure.

In my spare time - I like to read, practice my uke or recently, I have been trying to paint with watercolors.

I write here...(sometimes).

This website is part of an ongoing existence to document a little bit of my work, opinions and thoughts in a single place.

yada yada - interesting crap about moi.
