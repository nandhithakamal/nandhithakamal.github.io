Hello hello hello! It's been a while since I had any serious reading done.
Started the year by trying to maintain momentum and then things went South when Thatha fell sick.
Anyway, back at it, I guess and hopefully it sustains.

I just finished reading "Day's End Stories: Life After Sundown in Small-Town India" - a collection of stories/essays by different writers/journalists as they recount their experiences on what nightlife or rather lives at nights are like in "small town India" Small town India - I don't like this term.
We're just cities/towns and there are big cities. It sounds like it is written for people in the big cities - like we are alien specimens and they have no fucking clue as to what us species could live like...
Treating us like creatures you'd put on your labcoat and observe under a microscope, making notes and throwing arms up in the air when you encounter mild signs of intelligence.

Anyway, that out of the way, I very much enjoyed the book. It was a hard read at first, mostly because of the circumstances, but was quite easy to finish off today.
I came home to Coimbatore and there is a lot of quiet here.
Quiet, and time and space that naturally allows for things like this to take place smoothly without any struggle.
Maybe this is a small-town thing.
I don't necessarily think Coimbatore is a  "small town".
It is definitely a smaller city than Bangalore and there is a serious dearth of 'nightlife' here - but that doesn't mean there is no life at night here.
Nights are quiet, calming and moonlit.
I never realised I would be able to acknowledge and appreciate moonlit nights being a thing, that moonlit would become a defining thing.
